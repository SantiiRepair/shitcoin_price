## Features

Get the price in BUSD of any token on the Ethereum network and its subnets such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and others more.

## Getting started

Add the package to your pubspec.yaml file as shown below.
```dart

dependencies:

  shitcoin_price: any

```

Then import the package into your code like this.
```dart

import 'package:shitcoin_price/shitcoin_price.dart';

```
## Usage

You can call the function and give it the parameters it wants to query, for example:


```dart
final priceDouble = await ShitCoinPrice().asDouble(rpc: string, router: string, token: string);
print(priceDouble); // 2.688667399210412 CAKE
```

Or

```dart
final priceBigInt = await ShitCoinPrice().asBigInt(rpc: string, router: string, token: string);
print(priceBigInt); // 2688667399210411713 CAKE
```

In this example we import the package function and use it to get the price of a token, in this case CAKE and it returns a double or bigint number depending on how you handle the logic of the function.

- rpc: The rpc url on the network that we want to query.
- router: The address of the router, Uniswap, Pancakeswap, SushiSwap, or other.
- token: The address of the contract of the token that we want to consult the price.

NOTE: Check the test folder for an example implementation.
